## Additional information

The [svg library used](lib/svg) is mostly a rewrite of pythons [svg.path][svg.path].
This is what kanimaji originally used for animation, and even thought there's a lot of svg path parsers in dart, I found none that was able to calculate the length of the path. If you do find one, please let me know!
